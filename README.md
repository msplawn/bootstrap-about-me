# **Project Description**
For this project I created a 3 page website about myself using Bootstrap. My goal was to create a navigation bar and a responsive layout compatible on all sized viewports. I wanted to achieve this with minimal use of media queries. I also tried to utilize Bootstrap's row & column system efficiently.

# **Usage**
The site's purpose is threefold. The index is meant to tell possible employers and clients who I am and show them how strikingly handsome I am. The portfolio page is to provide an clean and organized space to view various projects I've worked on. The contact page is a form for people to reach out to me via email.
